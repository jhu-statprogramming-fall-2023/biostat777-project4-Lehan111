# Introduction

In this analysis, we want to learn about the age and gender distribution of this dataset.

The original data comes from tidyverse: [saferparks](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2019/2019-09-10/saferparks.csv) and [tx_injuries](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2019/2019-09-10/tx_injuries.csv).

You can check data dictionary for the data at [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-09-10#tx_injuriescsv).

# Data analysis

First, we load the local data into R.

```{r}
tx_injuries <- readr::read_csv("data/tx_injuries.csv")
safer_parks <- readr::read_csv("data/safer_parks.csv")
```

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(lubridate)
library(purrr)
library(survival)
safer_parks <- safer_parks %>% drop_na(num_injured)
year <- safer_parks$acc_date |>
  map(.f = ~as.Date(.x, format = "%m/%d/%Y")) |>
  map_dbl(.f = ~year(.x))
safer_parks <- mutate(safer_parks, year)
year_trend <- safer_parks %>% group_by(year) %>% summarise(n = sum(num_injured))
```

```{r}
plot <- ggplot(year_trend, aes(x = year, y = n)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Annual number of injuries", x = "Year", y = "Number of injuries") +
  theme_minimal()

# Save the plot to a file (change the file format and filename as needed)
ggsave("anual.png", plot, width = 8, height = 6, units = "in")

```

The graph shows that it has the highest number of injuries at the year of 2015.

```{r}
tx_injuries <- tx_injuries %>% drop_na(age)
tx_injuries <- tx_injuries %>% drop_na(gender)
tx_injuries <- tx_injuries %>%
  filter(!(age %in% c("n/a", "na", "n.a")))
tx_injuries <- tx_injuries %>%
  mutate(gender = toupper(gender)) %>%
  filter(!(gender %in% c("n/a", "na", "n.a", "N/A", "NA")))
year1 <- tx_injuries$injury_date |>
  map(.f = ~as.Date(.x, format = "%m/%d/%Y")) |>
  map_dbl(.f = ~year(.x))
tx_injuries <- mutate(tx_injuries, year1)
gender_trend <- tx_injuries %>% group_by(gender) %>% summarise(n = n())
plot2 <- ggplot(gender_trend, aes(x = gender, y = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "skyblue", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Number of injuries", x = "Gender", y = "Number of injuries") +
  theme_minimal()
ggsave("gender.png", plot2, width = 8, height = 6, units = "in")
```

It seems that females get injured more often than males.

```{r}
comparison <- data.frame(tx_injuries)
comparison$age <- as.numeric(comparison$age)
comparison <- comparison %>% drop_na(year1)
plot3 <- ggplot(comparison, aes(x = gender, y = age)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "lightblue", color = "black", width = 0.6) +
  labs(title = "Comparison between males and females", x = "Gender", y = "Age distribution") +
  theme_minimal() +
  facet_wrap(~year1, scales = "free_y")
ggsave("gender2.png", plot3, width = 8, height = 6, units = "in")
```

The age distributions between males and females are different at each year. In 2013 and 2014, more younger males get injured than females. And situation got opposite in 2015.

```{r}
comparison$event <- 1
survfit(Surv(year1, event) ~ gender, data = comparison)
```

# Conclusion

The numbers of injuries varies from years and gender.
