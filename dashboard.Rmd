# About

## Column

### Purpose of this dashboard 

This dashboard investigates the pattern of individual and park's injuries in United states. The original data comes from tidyverse: [saferparks](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2019/2019-09-10/saferparks.csv) and [tx_injuries](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2019/2019-09-10/tx_injuries.csv). Additional data can be found at [SaferParks Database](https://ridesdatabase.org/saferparks/data/).


In this dashboard, we explore:

1. Safety Tips

2. Previous Outcomes

3. Distribution of Park Injuries

4. Distribution of Taxas Injuries

### Safety tips for riders of all ages

Most amusement ride injuries can be prevented if you know what to watch out for.

### Top 10 Tips for Parents

Treat amusement ride safety seriously, just like traffic safety, water safety, and bike safety.

## Row {data-height=250}

### Carnival Safety Video

Kids and adults can learn how to have a safe, fun time on the midway.

### Minimum Height Restrictions

For some kids on some rides, minimum height limits set by manufacturers may be too low for safety.

### Find the Ride that Fits

For safety's sake, make sure the ride fits the rider, especially for kids.

# Analysis

## Column

### Example Analysis

**Data analysis**

::: {#fig-obs-loc}
![](anual.png){width="65%"}
:::
Figure 1

The figure shows that it has the highest number of injuries at the year of 2015.

::: {#fig-obs-loc}
![](gender.png){width="65%"}
:::
Figure 2

It seems that females get injured more often than males.

::: {#fig-obs-loc}
![](gender2.png){width="65%"}
:::
Figure 3

The age distributions between males and females are different at each year. In 2013 and 2014, more younger males get injured than females. And situation got opposite in 2015.


**Conclusion**

The numbers of injuries varies from years and gender.
